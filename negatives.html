            <h1>What are the negatives of The Internet Of Things?</h1>
            <p>IoT has privacy and security problems. Using wireless technologies can make data more available for <a href="https://www.imd.org/iot/iot-refections/pros-and-cons-of-iot/" target="_blank">theft</a>, exposing confidential information. Portable and wireless devices like phones and laptops can contain online banking and business information. This data, mixed with increased complexity in securing these devices, makes them a great target. Adding Internet of Things data such as how often you leave your house, when, or your frequent travel routes, may enable criminals to target you or your house. The amount of data collected may also make any anonymity on the internet near impossible, with data being collected on your location, age, name, and banking details.</p>
            <article>
                <p>Shirin Absolum’s presentation “Our Data Demons” does a wonderful job of explaining the negative aspects of Big Data. Although their discussion goes into more detail and is focused on Big Data, the problems of data privacy in a time when significant amounts of data about us is being collected is very relevant to The Internet of Things.</p>

            <h2>Too much of anything is bad.</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/internet-of-things/living-with-iot-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank">Dependence</a> on technology and its intrusion into everyday life can be harmful. Problems from social media creating a desire to impress others, online advertising pushing poor quality products, and being an arm’s reach from connecting to work virtually even outside of working hours are bad enough. Add more technology to novelty items can make disconnecting from technology, even temporarily, harder.</p>
            <p><i>How much time do you spend on technology?</i></p>
            <p>The following links can show you how to find the amount of time spent on your phone or Window's device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00085547/" target="_blank">Samsung</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208982#:~:text=To%20see%20the%20report%2C%20go,up%20or%20received%20a%20notification." target="_blank">Apple</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/set-screen-time-limits-on-your-kids-devices-a593d725-fc4c-044c-284d-32eab0305ffd" target="_blank">Window's device</a> <i>*Requires a Family Account</i></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Factor in 6 to 8 hours of sleep, and the time using other devices such as televisions, how much time are you spending daily using technology? Adding more novelty pieces may use up what little time remains.</p>
