            <p>The Internet of Things is more commonplace than many people may think. Smart phones and smart watches nowadays may feel normal, but are equipped with censors and processors that helped evolve them from their early days of candle stick telephones and analog watches. But this evolution of technology is not completely understood, and its impact on the world is much greater than people may give it credit for.</p>

                <h1>What is The Internet Of Things?</h1>
                <p>The internet of things is a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/au/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/" target="_blank">network of physical objects</a> that have embedded sensors, software, technologies, and research disciplines. These “things” can then connect to other services and transmit data over the internet. This creates a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/what-is-the-iot/" target="_blank">network of connected things</a>, from household appliances to industrial level machinery, shoes to tractors, and light bulbs to entire cities. This enables us to understand how these devices function, how humans operate, and about the connection between humans and technology. This is made possible by the data they collect and transmit.</p>
