            <h1>How can The Internet of Things impact industries?</h1>
            <p>Industrial Internet of Things is considered the <a href="https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/internet-of-things/industrial-iot/overview.html" target="_blank"></a>fourth industrial revolution</a>. Cutting edge technology and Internet of Things platforms enable <a href="https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/manufacturing/manufacturing-industrial-overview.html" target="_blank">increased efficiency</a> in manufacturing industries. Machines can be monitored for their performances to ensure they are not wasting resources or energy. Near-real-time analytics enable decision making to suit day-to-day changes in operations or the environment. The use of <a href="https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/internet-of-things/industrial-iot/it-ot-convergence.html" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a> can enable machines to detect defects during production or replace human labour in repetitive tasks such as ensuring labels are positioned where needed.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/au/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/" target="_blank">Machine to Machine (M2M) communication</a> and using the cloud has enabled wireless automation and control of machines. This reduces the cost of human resources, and in events such as Covid-19 or during malfunctions, allow operation to occur while <a href="https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/internet-of-things/industrial-iot/it-ot-convergence.html" target="_blank">social distancing</a> and staying away from dangerous situations.</p>

            <h1 id="temp">Use Cases</h1>
            <p class="explainUseCases">Below are use cases as provided by Intel and Amazon Web Services. These are just some of the examples of the power of The Internet of Things has to improve industries and economic systems far beyond the scope of an everyday consumer. This technology can help reduce the waste polluting our earth and spot potentially fatal flaws before a product ever makes it to market. This technology has the potential to increase quality of life and aid our dying planet.</p>
